## Safe Pay Tutorial

- Solana program code to initialize a new payment, complete a payment, pull back a payment
- Unit tests for golden path scenarios

### What is the purpose of this project?

Nothing aside from teaching people how to program with Anchor. This program is not too useful and, most importantly, this program is not audited ðŸ˜€.

### Where do I start?

- Install Anchor 0.18 [here](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html)
- Install Node v17.0.1 or greater (we are using v17.0.1 here as reference)
- run `npm intall` to ensure dependencies are met
- run `anchor test` and all tests should run successfully!
